## GraphQL Basics

This is the first project for Stephen Grider's ["GraphQL with React: The Complete Developer's Guide"](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-with-react-course/learn). It contains exercises on basic GraphQL tasks such as querying, creating schemas, and mutations. This code is mostly in line with the course videos, but I've made a few small changes.
